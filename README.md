# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-Codsoft

I built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction details. I experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. Through this process, I aimed to identify the most effective model for fraud detection.
